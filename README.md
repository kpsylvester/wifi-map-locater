# wifi-map-locater


## Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Knockout.js, and the Googlemap api. 

So this wifi locater features five areas in Elk Grove that offer free wifi to people. Who are near or in that specific location. I must say this is one of the most challenging web apps I have ever worked on. But it was also very reward because it pushed me to research in ways I have never done before. Finding creative solutions that weren't too cumbersome.

I hope you enjoy using the map. I tried to make the design clean and minimal while being dark. I want to make more proects with a dark theme. It makes things mysterious and easy on the eyes.
